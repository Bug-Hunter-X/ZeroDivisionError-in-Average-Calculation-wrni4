This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The original code had a potential error where it could raise a ZeroDivisionError if the input list was empty. A solution is provided to handle the empty list case gracefully. The solution adds a check for an empty list before attempting to calculate the average, preventing the ZeroDivisionError.
